      \---------------


      The **700 SGD scholarship** (a spin-off from
      [Pick1Thing.com](http://pick1thing.com/))


      If you have picked 1 thing and you have an idea to do good but you need
      some money to make happen, you can apply for our 700 SGD scholarship. How
      many we give out each year depends on how many offerings of scholarships
      are raised. The requirements are easy: 1) you need to invest in a cause
      that makes the world better for people; and 2) you need to share back
      proof of how the money was used.


      If you have a great idea, don't be shy - write to us. You can also write
      to us if you want to offer a similar scholarship (via Integral Singapore
      or on your own blog/ site/ page/ setup).
