        title: Can You Really Move on From Your Ex? Shane & Rachel [Acceptance]
        content: >-
          Meeting Shane for the first time as a stranger, Rachel shared about
          the pain from a heartbreak that resurfaced during the quarantine. What
          do you do when someone who's not only your lover, but also a friend,
          and a dance partner you see regularly cut you off from your life? Can
          you really fight off the ego that wants to be perceived in certain
          ways in front of your ex? Shane discussed this vulnerably with Rachel
          and shared how he dealt with the death of his ex-girlfriend.


          We'd like to thank Shane and Rachel for their vulnerability and courage to share their story with the world. We hope you find catharsis, strength, and inspiration from what they've shared.
